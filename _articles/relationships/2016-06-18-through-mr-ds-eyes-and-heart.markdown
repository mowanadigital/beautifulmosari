People think the first year of marriage is a walk in the park; they believe the couple is still on the honeymoon phase but alas, sit down and hear the ugly truth from me. Hell, I think the second year is a charm because you finally wake up from the wedding hangover (it is an ass than one, knocks you right out, brains and all). You see, studies have revealed that most marriages fail within the first year, I will tell you why….it’s because soon after the wedding we relax, put our feet up, sip on some cocktails  and think, “I am married, I got the man/woman”, well I say so????? You certainly are not the first and definitely not the last! Simple things like combing your hair, taking out the trash and wearing that racy lace underwear seem to elude one’s mind. It’s like our romantic bones are cast out as soon as we say for “better or worse, till death do us part”, I know it sounds pretty final but hei you signed up for it. You know you are on a fast train to divorce when you are supposedly “too tired” to play a little bedroom golf or kisses become some sort of a luxury like Ferrero Rocher or caviar (BTW I don’t take nuts nor do I know what caviar is).

I have seen a lot of people lose themselves in their marriages, well I could point at myself if I could stop typing, I didn’t forget to say nearly right? coz I wouldn’t be writing this if I was lost! We subconsciously overlook our friends, our family, the things and people who really make us laugh and focus on that one person, camaan! Really? All that attention on one person? That sounds like a recipe for disaster! We forget our own individual dreams; I mean there should be more to my life than being a Mrs. We can lie to ourselves and think getting that house, having that baby, getting that car, finishing that project will make us the happiest couple….tell me, how many people do you know who have all these and more and still ended up divorcing??? I think we worry too much about getting those material things and that defeats the purpose of a Godly union. What I am saying is that unless you are one of those lucky or unlucky ones (depending on how you look at it) who had the liberty to walk into a ready-made home then don’t sweat that out. You can’t put yourself under such pressure during the first year.  Work hard for your dreams, but work harder on your union. It’s a full time job and remember, the trick here is to love a continuously changing person. It’s hard yes….thing is even YOU keep changing. I am not the same person I was yesterday, heck maybe all these things I am saying won’t make sense to me tomorrow.

Maybe I am saying a whole lot of rubbish, but I think intimacy (no need to play daft, you know exactly what I mean), spiritual and emotional connection is a one way ticket to success in your marriage and all your dreams
NB: Ladies: those big ass comfortable cotton panties with a thick waist band are a NO! NO! (But they are comfy shame) and for once wear matching underwear hao! …..and oh! Always, always cook a mean meal (if u can cook that is, if u can’t please stick to what you know best….he still married YOU remember?

Gentlemen:  Who said you are to stop wooing her? That ring on her finger won’t do all the work for you. You are the king of the castle right? Well….I assume you know how they treat Mmamosadinyana ko lontone kwa ? Right….if you don’t then I suggest you take that flight to England to take a few pointers.

Enjoy my 1 page of utter madness…..MAD’O signing out (as I enjoy that 2nd year of marriage in my matching underwear)
