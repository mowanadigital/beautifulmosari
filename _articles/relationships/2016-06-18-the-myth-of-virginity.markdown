“It is more fable than fact that a woman’s virginity can be determined by observing her hymen. The organ looks like the petals of flowers with clefts and notches. It is flexible with different densities”.

Virginity is priced more than silver and gold in Africa, particularly in West Africa where this article is mainly focused. Right from the day a girl child is born, she is prepared for marriage and servant hood to her husband. Furthermore, the poor child is warned sternly once she sees her period to stay off men and preserve the precious thin membrane of blood lining in her vagina. Some parents go to the extent of circumcising and sealing their daughters with different types of sealing materials such as leaves, sticks, cow dung. The pain, even to those who have never experienced this, is as sharp as a cut from a brand new knife!

Let’s think about it... What exactly is so precious about virginity? For a mother, it is a sign that she has accomplished the epitome of motherhood, she has trained her daughter well and her dowry price is to be as high as possible.  For a woman, it makes her whole and complete; she will be revered as a virtuous and respected woman. In other words no matter what her achievements are, career wise, she will not be respected if this hymen is not  presented on the night of her wedding.

In the most part of West Africa, it is to be presented on a piece of plain white cloth where the bride and groom have laid down and the groom has pierced her womanhood. If in the case of someone who has been circumcised and sealed, the opening up is to be done at the hospital, and immediately to sleep with her husband to avoid the opening closing up. This is akin to giving birth twice in one sitting!

In other parts of Africa, such as a particular village in Morocco, the virginity test is somewhat not practical. In their case, an egg is used and the woman lays on her back with her legs spread wide. The “tester”, usually an older woman, would then crack open an egg into her vagina, if the egg slips easily into the opening, she is considered not to be a virgin.

No matter the method used, there are two aspects used to determine virginity: an intact hymen and a tight vaginal opening. However, what society fails to acknowledge is that the hymen alone does not make one a virgin. There are actually some women who are not born with hymens and some lose it in various ways. In other instances, some women do not even lose it during penetrative sex because of its complex structure.

What is the bottom line? The issue that arises is that there is no hard and fast rule to what a virgin is. As earlier highlighted it is a sexual act where the penis penetrates the vagina. But does that mean, then, that a woman who has only had female partners is a virgin? Is a homosexual who has only had anal sex, a virgin? One would agree that, no, these people are not virgins even if they’ve never had penis-in-vagina style intercourse and still have their hymens intact.

Society has failed to inculcate the rationale why traditionally the preservation of the hymen was cherished and encouraged. It has now been reduced to a mere cosmetic illusion of chastity. And girls have even resorted to losing it and restoring it by surgical and medical means. This is growing to become a million dollar industry in Africa and Asia. Because of the high pedestal, virginity is placed on; girls will do everything that is sexual except penetration hence defeating the purpose of the preservation, which is to uphold morals and customs of not engaging in premarital sexual intercourse. 

But as of late it is reduced to a money-making venture by some as it brings in suitors who will give a huge sum to their virgin bride. Woe betide the bride that is not found with a hymen! Instances in the past have seen a woman committing suicide because of the humiliation of losing her hymen. The whole family will be put to shame and the man will likely lose respect for his wife, often times using the incident to insult her subsequently. The coming into force of all these international and national laws protecting women does little for her dignity with regards to this aspect of a woman’s life.

The paradox is that the rule is exclusive to women alone; men are not required to stay chaste in our society. A man can have as many women as he chooses before marriage and all he gets is to be jokingly called a “he-goat”. On the other hand women do not do the deed on their own but they do it with men. If it is prohibitions, it should be applied to both parties as it takes two to tango.

The essence I believe is to ensure that children are not born out of wedlock and they can easily trace their lineage.

I am in no way stating that the preservation of virginity should be done away with. All I am putting across is it should not be by any means be a tool of discrimination or superiority as it is currently been manifested. The idea that you can somehow tell if a woman has been touched has contributed to the oppression and subjugation of woman over the centuries. It has continued to give men a way to control women and their bodies. It has further led to a double standard where it is fine, even encouraged for boys to gain sexual experience, but women who are sexually active before marriage or any presumption that she might have done sexual acts whether voluntarily or involuntarily are seen to be damaged goods and unworthy. A paradigm shift must be employed in society with regards to how female children are brought up on the concept of virginity because the methods being used are clearly not working.
