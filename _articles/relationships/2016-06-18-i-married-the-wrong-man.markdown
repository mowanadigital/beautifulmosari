It’s one of those breezy beautiful afternoons; you know the ones you wish you could take a walk instead of being stuck in traffic?? Yeah, well...there we were with my Booba (pet name for my husband), flustered and impatient and then he says something that pisses me off.   He mumbles something about women being crappy drivers; you do understand why I am pissed right? RIGHT. For starters I am a woman; HIS woman...so a little respect for women when I am around would definitely help!

So, I look at him and wonder; did I marry the wrong man? How can this man not understand me? Why are we poles apart? I mean, just listening to morning radio will spark a debate that will last the entire journey to work,  we affiliate with two different political parties and everyone knows I always want to have the last word (well I am working on the “last word” issue because it’s definitely not working for me  in this marriage).

Being the feminist I am, I can’t help but fume all the way home, my mind silently constructing a retort for his annoying comment. I march into the house and go straight to our bathroom and BAM! He forgot to put the toilet seat down. What the hell is wrong with this man? I mutter to myself.  Promising myself to have a word with him later I walk into our kitchen, there he is; all handsomeness busy washing dishes. He notices me, winks and makes a funny face. I can’t help but smile, he smiles back and then we both laugh. You see, he does that to me...annoys me just as much as he makes me laugh, often doing little things for me...like never forgetting to record my favourite TV programme, or watering my favourite plant. I did marry the right man...He loves me and my imperfections. He challenges me; He definitely is no pushover and HE IS THE RIGHT MAN FOR ME.
