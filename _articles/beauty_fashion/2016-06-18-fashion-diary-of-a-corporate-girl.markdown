How does the modern corporate woman look like? Serious? Stylish? Elegant? Sophisticated?  Are there specific cooperate colours? A bit of grey and black plus the staple white shirt? Women look good in their blacks, but the colour gets to look super sleek when paired with the right colors and accessories. For all the corporate women trying not to be boring and dull at the office, enjoy the fashion diary of a corporate girl… and thank us later.

### **Mondays…………….. so depressing**!
Feeling blue…..the weekend is over! Here’s how to get over the weekend hype in style. A bright red or burgundy skirt worn with a crisp white shirt. Add a bit of sparkle with a plain gold neck piece and bright red lip colour. You will look and feel powerful yet sexy and chic. This look will brighten up your mood and chase away the blues.

### **Tuesday is tone it down day**
Be subtle yet unforgettable in a sexy yet sophisticated dress which is a guaranteed head turner.

### **Wednesday is the day to be bold**
Bold neckpieces are not for the shy ladies. You have to be ready to get all sorts of looks and questions… all of which to be taken in stride. Neckpieces reveal the kind of woman you are so they should be chosen with great care. Try an all black outfit and wear an outstanding piece of art on your neck. Finish off the look with equally bold lipcolour and bang!

### **Thursday ……mood perked up!**
It is the perfect day to pull out the pencil skirt.
Good day to go for an all white look with a blazer and a camisole. How about a crop top? Yes, it has to look appropriate!  Wear it with a high waisted skirt such that it covers you mid-section. A statement outfit for the fashion forward woman!

### **Fridays... after work plans already!**
Carefully consider your evening chronicles. Ask yourself “is this outfit fabulous enough for me to hit town after work with the ladies, without having to go home for a quick change?” That is a very important question. Here goes: it’s time to be totally switched on! Edge is the order of the day. Most corporate workplaces allow their employees to be casual on Friday so unleash the fashionista in you. A see through top with wide leg pants and a blazer. Later on, remove the blazer and put on a statement neck piece. This look will take you from the office straight to after work sinks with the girls.
