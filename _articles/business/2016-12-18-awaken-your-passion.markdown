##Who is Kefhilwe?
**A young Motswana woman,a wife and a mother.** I'm the proud owner of The White Palace Hotel in Serowe village,a business which was born in 2011. I have a Business Administration (Marketing) degree from the University of Botswana and an MBA from Business School in South Africa. These qualifications helped me to get a job in the banking sector. I was a banker for 3 years then worked for a parastatal for 6 years.

**I draw my inspiration from a lot of factors.** My parents, my husband, my travels,my reading etc. My parents worked full time jobs but also ran businesses on the side to supplement their salaries. Some of their businesses failed, but it never deterred them from starting new ones. They still have a few even today. 

My mum enrolled my siblings and I to a book club in South Africa, and we received books on a monthly basis. We were also members of the local library. Therefore I read a lot, and all the stories I read inspired me. I came across a book called **_Hotel_** when I was 11, and it inspired me to start my own hotel one day. I didn't even fully understand that dream at that age, but it was there on my vision board until I did eventually started planning everything. I still have that book!

My husband: When I met him, he also had his dreams of owning hotels. He is a specialist in the field of Tourism, having studied it and worked as a professional in the field. Our brainstorming sessions always result in the most outrageous ideas! He inspires me daily to be the best I can, and he is a great business partner.

Travels: I also love to travel, and everywhere I go think of how I'd have set up the establishments I stayed in, if they were mine! An experiential hotel stay is my ultimate pleasure.

##The journey
I saved a lot of my salary because I wanted a self-funded business. In 2008 I went to work in Kasane, the tourism hub. That further ignited my dream and on weekends I'd visit the local hotels to see how they were set up.

After meeting someone who was as passionate as I am about the business, and had the same dreams and goals as I did, we decided to set up business in Serowe. In 2010 we forfeited having a white wedding so we could use our savings to start the hotel and we opened for business in April 2011. We are now running the business together on a full time basis.We have since opened a boutique guest-house in Serowe.

The journey has been great and challenging. In 2012 we expanded and opened another hotel in Francistown. It turned out to be a not so great business decision and we closed shop in 2014. The experience taught me a lot though and I am a lot more careful in the decisions I make and how they affect the bigger picture.

Over the years we have acquired land in Kasane, Nata, Gweta and that is the where we will expand to. We do have other business interests we will be pursuing in the greater Gaborone area.

##Words of advice
It is quite easy to be swept away by eagerness to make money and the excitement of a new enterprise. One should take their time to understand what their goals for the business require them to do and really work hard achieve the goals.

Time management and strategic planning are essential elements of any project. Understanding the need for proper planning throughout all the stages of starting and running a hotel will help one to select the right people to work with and define the market. Market segmentation helps any business person to package and execute their ideas appropriately to suit their target market.
