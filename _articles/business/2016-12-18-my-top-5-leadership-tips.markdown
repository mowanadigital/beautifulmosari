**1. Be confident** in your own abilities, people believe in confident people. If you lack confidence it will show and leave doubt as to whether you are capable of that which you profess to know. Think about it, if you had to invest P1m or whatever amount you view as substantial, would you give it to someone who is hesitant and not sure, or someone who exudes confidence and seems like they know what they are talking about? The answer is obvious.

**2. Know what you are talking about**, know your subject matter, be an expert. The abundance of information has made us extremely lazy, lazy to research and understand issues deeply. I am sure you have heard the expression, " just google it", right! Nothing wrong with googling stuff, but if it's stuff you are supposed to know and give advise on, I would venture to say, read wildly to understand issues and enrich your knowledge, backup your knowledge with professional qualifications. It shows when you have superficial knowledge, one peel from a knowledgeable audience and your facade will crumble. Arm yourself with real knowledge, the old adage "knowledge is power" still holds true!

**3. Work hard**, I am yet to meet someone who hasn't worked hard for their success! As the saying goes, the harder you work the luckier you become. Ever heard the expression “opportunity meets preparedness?".

**4. Love what you do** because when you really care about what you do, it gets easier even when its challenging. Passion is the fuel that propels us to achieve our best, without it you are most certain do be mediocre or even fail. Live your passion everyday, let it shine through and success and money, if at all that's what you wish for, will follow.

**5. Dream, Dream and Dream big!** Please don't mistake this for day dreaming! There is power in our dreams! I suspect that behind every earth shattering milestone, be it a technological innovation, fashion design, breaking of athletic records, lies a man or woman who dreamt that dream. Visualise yourself as you achieve your dream, be your own number one fan! Do not allow fear to hold you back from your dreams! I like the expression “the greatest failure of all is fear to fail". Failure is but a momentary pause, a time to review and refine and continue that which we started. Do not fear to fail, embrace failure as part of your journey, BE BOLD!
