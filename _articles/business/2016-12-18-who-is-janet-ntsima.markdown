**Who is Motshidisi Janet Ntsima?**
I am a 41 year old mother to an 11 year old boy, a qualified secondary school teacher, a trainer in the hospitality industry for the past 15 years, and a business owner.

**What’s your educational/training background?**
I possess a Diploma in Secondary Education from Tonota College of Education and just after one year of working as a teacher I decided to quit and join the hospitality industry.

**Take us through your journey as an entrepreneur. How did you fall in love with the hospitality business, and where did it all start?**
Well, as already mentioned I worked for only one year as a teacher and decided this was not for me… and I quit. Someone close to me was opening a lodge and so I jumped at the opportunity to help run its daily operations. 
It wasn’t until I joined the hospitality industry and started enjoying working there as a trainer that the business-bug hit me. You see, for as long as I can remember, my mother has always been in business but it wasn’t until I moved to SA that I fell in love with the idea of opening my own business. That was two years ago.

**What is your core business?**
Ever since I arrived in Johannesburg, SA, I had been dreaming of starting my own company in hospitality supplies. Last year the opportunity to do that presented itself and I went for it.
The following are the services that MJ Hospitality Solutions provide:

Training (Classroom and On-The-Job)
* Mentoring
* Coaching
* Hospitality Supplies


**Starting out is usually a challenge for a lot of people, how did you get funded or what creative strategies did you use to execute on minimal cash flow?**
I did not get any funding to start my business, I risked my life savings and followed my instincts. It has not been easy I tell you but I am still persevering.

**The journey so far?**
Being able to make my first goods delivery against all odds. You have to realize that there’s bound to be challenges transporting goods from SA to Botswana. I had my fare share of disappointments with a delivery company which resulted in my goods taking a full week to be delivered instead of the normal two days. I suppose in the end I managed to get the goods to the client in good time and form, due to good communication and patience on my part with regards to the courier company I had used.

**Looking at where you are now, if you could have given yourself a piece of advice when you started what would that be?  Which opportunities should you have followed; what pitfalls would you have avoided?**
I would have advised myself not to easily trust anyone whilst in business. I made a lot of mistakes when I chose the courier company. I chose a company which had been used by a friend before and I thought they were reliable and so I didn’t ask the right questions and didn’t demand proof of reliability…the normal things that one has to ask for when choosing a courier company.

**Every industry has its own challenges can you share with us some of those that you deal with on a daily basis?**
The main challenge for me is being able to convince prospective clients that though I am a one-man company, I can fully deliver. You see because I have just started operating, it would not be wise for me to take on people to work under me. I have to grow first and clinch some contracts… then I can set up office and get all the personnel needed.

**Entrepreneurship is all about taking risks? What are some of the key risks you have had to take and how have they impacted your business?**
I believed in my dream so much that I decided to move to SA to see it realized. That on its own is a risk because I first have to find my way around the business community and feel the flow of business. Now I am learning as I go. This hasn’t had a negative impact on my business though.

**Running a business is not child’s play, some quit before they even start and some give up along the way. How do you conquer those moments of doubt that so often stifle or stop so many entrepreneurs with great ideas?**
You’re right about it not being child’s play. What drives me is the end result, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. I believe the challenges I am going through are just part of teething problems for any starting business and so I am forging ahead with the belief that I will make it. I choose to surround myself with people who are making it in business so I can learn better ways of making it in business.

**Where do you draw your support?**
One business man and friend, who is also in the training business. He believed in my dream and agreed to mentor me through all things business.

**What is your mantra and how has it translated into your work ethics?**
“For as long as there is breath in your lungs, never give up”- This motto explains my entire existence as a human being, especially in my adult life. I have refused to allow challenges in life to dictate who and what I become in life. I choose get up and continue or carve a new route when I fail in one area. I have a legacy to leave for my generation. And that is what I believe for my business as well. Watch this space…

**What are you doing to ensure you continue to grow with this business and develop as an entrepreneur?**
I will continue to surround myself with seasoned business people and study the trends in order to grow.

**Your thoughts on the general business landscape?**
There isn’t enough support for new business owners in terms of mentoring and skills impartation. And for some of us across the border, the consulate or embassy should do more to support us and the “Buy Botswana” brand.

**What are your views on the hospitality industry?**
There is no market for hospitality industry in Botswana, or the market is saturated now, simply because there is no buying power. Most hospitality set ups survive via the patronage of the government departments and that cake is too small for all of us meaning the share is very small now.

**What sets you apart from the rest in your industry?**
Perseverance and adding a personal touch to all that I do for my clients.

**Looking at the issue of unemployment what role can the private sector play in creating more sustainable job opportunities for young people?**
These young people need to do a lot of job shadowing in the various industries and ultimately be absorbed by the same companies. During the job shadowing, there should be mentoring and coaching provided for the young people/graduates to as to harness their skills.

**What’s the future for your business where do see yourself in 5-10 years time?**
I would love to have set up a fully fletched hospitality training facility and a hospitality supplies outlet/warehouse

**How do you relax?**
I go to church and engage in Kingdom ministry. If not I spend time with family because family tends to suffer when one is growing a business.

**What few resources would you recommend to someone looking to gain insight into becoming a better leader? Any books from your personal library you recommend us to read?**
Rich Dad, Poor Dad - Robert T. Kiyosaki. It emphasizes the concept of the “Three Piggybanks”. Kiyosaki stresses the importance of putting all money you make (aside from what you need to pay the bills) into three categories: Savings, Investing and Tithing
As a small business owner, this savings method can help you actively sock away money for those “big dream” items you once thought were unattainable. I think you can never learn this lesson too early. Everyone should engage these in order to work smarter, not harder.

**Advice to aspiring female entrepreneurs and those who are already in business**

* Never mix business with pleasure
* Take calculated risks
* Be determined
* Be courageous
