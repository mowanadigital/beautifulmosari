Family skin problems motivated this budding entrepreneur to explore organic beauty products, and the results have been amazing! Ms Portia Sthabiso Mokgathong, director of LaedyP Organics, talks to Beautiful Mosari about her business.

**Who is Laedy-P Organics**: This is a body care and household essentials producing company. We make body butters, soap bars, massage candles, bath salts, diffusers and shower gels. All of them are handmade! The self -funded company was registered late 2014.

**The inspiration came from**: My whole family has very sensitive skin so this pushed me to conduct some research, in search for what could work for us. With the information from my findings, I started creating body care products that we started using in the household. It has been four years since we started using them and we have never looked back. I was also motivated by the fact that, whenever I gave away some of these products to my friends and colleagues, they would instantly fall in love with them and would insist on paying for them almost all the time so I felt the need to share not only with people who are close to me but the rest of the world. 

**The journey**: Products were made available to customers for the very first time in February 2016, we sold a whole lot more than I expected and people were really impressed.  We had an opportunity to participate at the Youth Expo 2016. In addition, Laedy-P Organics and a few other youth led businesses where invited to exhibit at this yearâ€™s Botswana Consumer Fair where we won an award. It was such an amazing experience and I'm proud to have been able to stay the whole week, market and sell my products. A whole lot of potential customers were identified and I'm really pleased that all the customers who have bought keep coming back for more.

**Where are you now**: I am currently renovating my workshop in extension 5 Gaborone, but for one on one meetings with customers l have an office, hosted by  Development Advance Institute at 1268 Thusanyo house, products are always  available there. The production of our handcrafted products is a blend of both science and art. They come in a wide range of colors, scents, shapes, sizes and formulations. They could be playful and fun or designed for sensitive skin care. Products may also be customized. This kind of customization is a beautiful way of expressing yourself, your personality and your values. Laedy-P Organics products are considered a consumable art form that is fantastic to use, sell or give away as gifts. The users have happier and more moisturized skin, houses that smell great and inviting bathrooms! Very soon I will be supplying hotels and lodges, shops and other local hospitality outlets in Botswana and other countries but still keep the crafty side of the business for customers who prefer personalised products.

**Glitches**: One of my challenges is that due to lack of funding, it is quite difficult to operate the business smoothly. I cannot afford to hire assistants yet. In addition, sourcing raw materials is a challenge because most of them are either available in small quantities or unavailable at all in Botswana. Another challenge is that lack of machinery; it limits the company's ability to satisfy customers' demands, especially lodges and hotels because they need products in large quantities.

**Future plans**: I have so much passion for art and the ability to create extraordinary products out of a few simple raw materials. It is amazing. Not a single day goes by without me learning something new and exciting about this line of work! In future I plan to hire a good number of unemployed youth and I would also like to open a school where I will be conducting workshops.

**Advice**: Running a business is not easy but very possible with hard work, self discipline and passion. Make it a point that you research and learn as much as you can. Try to understand your market; this will enable you to serve your customers better.
