As People, we have a cry from within for a meaningful life. It is a deep craving inside. Many are trying to quench it in different ways; some have built all the wealth they could, others are high achievers academically, yet they still experience that void. This vacuum seems not to respect how much education one has acquired. Neither does it care about the wealth one has accumulated. This is a cry for purpose. Nothing whatsoever can be traded for it.

Each person has been sent to earth with a special unique assignment, and it is until you discover yours that you will be able to unleash the potential of greatness that is in you. The potential that exists in us is limitless. Each person has some hidden abilities and capabilities that they wouldn’t know exist until they pursue their own area.

In her book “Born For a Purpose” author Dimpho Monamesi advices you to accept the reality of who you are, and also motivates you to pursue that which will crown you for ages; the purpose for which you are born. She also teaches that since your assignment is unique, no other person can do it the way you can, so if you do not pursue it, you have robbed the world of all the inventions, creativity, the wisdom and the solutions that God has invested in you.

She strongly believes that the confusion in people’s lives today does not necessarily need another degree, or a change of jobs. It only needs one to identify their place in life. She teaches that purpose carries in it motivation, inspiration, urge, drive, creativity, passion, fulfillment and results, so if leading such a life one will easily reign over lack and depression.

Born For a Purpose, in all its eleven chapters, aims to awaken you, to remind you that you are an incredible and valuable individual who can achieve great things. It helps you to locate your field and live a purpose driven life.
