Beautiful Mosari caught up with the international model **_Mmina_** Gaebonwe and this is what she had to say about embracing the freedom to be herself. 

 

**BM**: How did modeling start for you, and how long have you been modeling?

**_Mmina_**: 9 years now, I won the first ever Gemstones Model Search.

**BM**: What initially intrigued you about modeling?

**_Mmina_**: Just being able to create and be a part of the art world has always been my calling and modeling is one of the ways I express myself as an artist.

**BM**: What drives you **_Mmina_**?

**_Mmina_**: Creativity and the arts. 

**BM**: What are some of your greatest achievements from the past and present?

**_Mmina_**: Past achievement was shooting a Woolworths commercial with Hugh Masekela and present I recently shot a movie with Kagiso Lediga. My first movie.

**BM**: What are some of the challenges you have to deal with in your line of work?

**_Mmina_**: It's frustrating that female models still receive less pay than male models. As a feminist this is something that I hope we are able to change in the future. We deserve the same rate for the same labor whether you are a man or woman.

**BM**: As one of the few models representing the country beyond boarders, what legacy do you want to leave behind, how do you want us to remember you?

**_Mmina_**:  I want to be remembered as a girl who loved her country, who loved her black sisters and wanted to make a better world for all the little girls growing up in rural villages in Botswana.

**BM**: Who do you look up to in your industry and how has that person influenced your life?

**_Mmina_**: I look up to all the black models breaking barriers and stereotypes. It's inspiring, fuels the fire in me to demand equality as a black model.

**BM**: If there is anything you could change about modeling in Botswana and Africa what will you change?

**_Mmina_**: Modeling is not a hobby, it's a full time job, it's an art, and it’s somebody's passion. The idea that modeling is something for girls with long legs has to change. Then, and only then can the industry in Botswana and Africa change.

**BM**: How do you keep fit and stay relevant in this competitive commercial modeling industry?

**_Mmina_**: It's a cliché but I drink lots of water, cut down on sugar. And always make sure I do my best- Do your job like you are receiving a million dollars for it.

**BM**: What is your beauty secret?

**_Mmina_**: Lots of Water and always wash your face before you sleep.

**BM**: Talking about beauty, a lot of people believe that the societal idea of beauty mainly affects self esteem negatively, how would you define beauty and the relentless quest for it?

**_Mmina_**: Beauty for me is CONFIDENCE. I used to be teased for being tall and thin, there is another girl in another place who was bullied for being too fat. Societal idea or definition beauty is unrealistic and unsure. I think teaching girl’s confidence is what we should be aiming for. Beauty ideas change but CONFIDENCE is eternal.

**BM**: What does independence mean to you?

**_Mmina_**: It means freedom to be, to create and to love.

**BM**: What are you doing to ensure that you maintain your independence and help to trickle it down to younger generations?

**_Mmina_**: Creativity is the only thing that's free, and we should take it where it's found. Teaching younger generations that they have freedom in creating is a must.  As long as I'm able to create and share that with somebody else and hopefully inspire them I will forever be free.

**BM**: What is on your bookshelf?

**_Mmina_**: The Creative Economy by John Howkins and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child by JK Rowling.

**BM**: What is your greatest indulgence? 

**_Mmina_**: Fur coats and fragrances.

**BM**: What do you love the most about modeling? 

**_Mmina_** Living different personas, everyday!

**BM**: From all the jobs you have done as a model, which one(s) stand out for you and why?

**_Mmina_**: The one when I filmed a commercial with Hugh Masekela. I'm a big fan of the legend.

**BM**: Advice to our readers?

**_Mmina_**: Always raise your voice to speak, for women, for Black people, for inequality of any kind for any injustice in the world so that those who are unable to speak can be heard through you.
