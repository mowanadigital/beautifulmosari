Oral hygiene needs change at different stages of a woman’s life and some stages result in a higher susceptibility to oral diseases than others. This is what happens at these different stages:

**Puberty:**
During puberty, there is an increase in the production of the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone which cause and increase blood flow to the gums.  The way the gum tissue reacts to irritants also changes, causing the gums to bleed easily or to swell.

**Menstruation:**
During a woman's monthly menstrual cycle, certain hormonal changes occur, particularly an increase in progesterone. Due to these changes, some women experience oral changes such as bright red swollen gums, canker sores (small, shallow ulcers that appear in the mouth) or bleeding gums.  These changes usually occur a few days before menstruation starts but clears up when the period starts.

**Pregnancy:**
During pregnancy, there are many changes that occur in the body and in particular to the hormone levels.  An increase in progesterone can cause gum disease any time during the second and eight month of pregnancy. Pregnant women may need to see the dentist more often to prevent pregnancy gingivitis.

Other common oral diseases that occur in pregnancy are benign growths on the gums, dental caries and tooth mobility. It is common for pregnant women to eat sugary snacks as a way of preventing nausea and to decrease pregnancy cravings.  This sugary diet creates an ideal environment for teeth to get cavities.

**Menopause:**
During menopause, oral changes can occur as a result of advanced age, hormonal changes or as a result to the medication taken to combat symptoms experienced during menopause.  These changes include altered taste, burning sensation in the mouth, increased sensitivity to hot and cold food and decreased salivary flow that can result in dry mouth.  Dry mouth can also result in tooth decay and gum disease because saliva is not available to clean the mouth by neutralizing acids produced by plaque.

Menopause also results in decreased oestrogen production and this puts women at a greater risk for loss of bone density.  Loss of bone density, especially in the jaw bones, can result in loss of teeth. 

**Birth Control Pills:**
Women taking birth control pills that contain progesterone may experience inflamed gums. Always tell your dentist if you are taking any contraceptives.

**Useful tips......**
* Brush with a fluoride toothpaste at least twice a day,  preferably  after meals
• Floss thoroughly everyday
* See a dentist every six months. This can assist the dentist in diagnosing and treating dental problems early. Always inform your dentist of any medication that you may be taking and any changes  in your  overall health since your last dental visit
•    Eat a well balanced diet 
•    Avoid sugary snacks
In conclusion, it is important to note that not every woman is affected the same way by puberty, menstruation, pregnancy and menopause. So it is up to every beautiful woman to take charge of her oral health and prevent oral diseases before they occur. Remember.... a smile is the shortest distance between two people.
