Leah: A Seer’s Legend, is fantasy novel written by Botho Lejowa, a young Motswana woman who takes on fantasy from a different standpoint. She takes a well needed departure from the normal werewolf and vampire story line by creating a whole new set of creatures we can get on board with in the fantasy world.  

Lejowa takes us through an emotional journey as Leah travels across the realms in search of the being that is trying to bring about an inter-realm war. Saved from a childhood of torture by Sect, an organisation made of magical humans, Leah finds that the leaders who saved her can no longer be trusted. The reader is thrown into a world of magical espionage as the atrocities performed by the villain worsen by the second. 

The imagery Lejowa conjures of the realms is as vivid as the characters she has created. The anxiety felt by the readers as Leah faces near death danger is as intense as the grief felt as Leah loses someone close to her heart. Lejowa cleverly throws a spanner in the works when the clear lines that define hero and villain become blurred.

Leah: A Seer’s Legend is a good read for lovers of the fantasy genre everywhere. The book gains momentum as the story continues and will have you up long into the night as the drama unfolds. The ending is very indicative of a sequel and we can only hope that Lejowa is working on book two of Leah’s story.
