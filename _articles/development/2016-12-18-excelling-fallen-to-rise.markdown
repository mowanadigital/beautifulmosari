The challenges of being a woman always seem to be an exaggeration, even to us women. A woman, a mother, an aunt, a sister, a counsellor, a confidante, a pillow and a “sponge”!  Yet, bearing all these badges of honour, the beautiful souls are expected to be strong, confident gentle, humble and courageous. They go through the pains of motherhood with pride, and through all this, remain the trophies of their men as they smile though tears, for the illusion of mankind to continue!

We fail, we fall, we make mistakes and get disappointed but no matter what life throws at us, we soldier on.  We know that there is no easy way out; one has to be on top of their game as there is more to conquer out there.

Phrases such as “a woman is the mother of the nation” motivate and help us remember how valuable and special we are. This phrase will go on and on for generations and it will continue to bring the exact meaning of what a true woman is. Whenever you see a woman under a tree or by the market selling something do not be quick to judge her. She is not there for fun or to just pass time like many may assume. There is always a great story behind that woman and unless you ask you will never get it.  In most cases you will find out that she does it to protect her children and to cover up the wrong doings of the other party. It is through these challenges that she gets to toughen up and with her head held up high she continues to push. For she knows that  hers is a battle she can and should never run away from but see it as an opportunity to unleash her true potential.

We see women today leading big organizations and some following career paths believed to be for men. That is the strength of a woman who knows what she wants. One who is prepared to follow the direction leading to her dreams and this will not in any way make her forget her role as a woman in the family. Being the pillar of her family still remains the top principle in her heart no matter how hard it gets. The bible requires a woman to be submissive to her husband, nature requires her  to be protective to her children, today life requires her to stand up and put food to the table, and do we see women saying NO!? I do not think so! We see her meeting all these requirements and asking and pleading for more responsibilities.

Women bear a resemblance to uneasy life lived with so much purpose. We can learn a lot and draw some inspiration from them. Think of how uneasy life is and how a woman tackles everything, you will see what really is meant by excellence.
