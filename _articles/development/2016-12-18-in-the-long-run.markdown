**Introduce Yourself to our readers?**

My name is Omphile Lesego Mmereki. I am a young lady, born and bred in Gaborone, but originally from Gabane. Omphile is a true Aquarius lady: adventure loving, independent, analytical and humble. I am 25 years old.

**What do you do for a living?**

I am currently in a period of transition; I’ve just completed my Post Graduate Diploma in Education, where I trained on how to be a French Teacher. I also hold a Bachelor’s Degree with majors in French and Psychology.

**You have taken part in the Comrades Marathon three times, how has been your experience in the marathon over the years?**

Taking part in comrades is hard to get used to. Each year I grow anxious and excited at the same time. The experience is completely indescribable. It is a humble yet exhilarating experience: humbling because you see so many people of all shapes and sizes from all over the world running (for different reasons), and some never finish. It is also amazing to see thousands of people lined up for 89km to support us along the route.

**How many Kilometres have you covered?**

Comrades Marathon is 89/87km annually. They have what we call a down run, which is from Pietermaritzburg to Durban (89km), and what we call the up run which is from Durban to Pietermaritzburg (87km). I have run 2 down runs and 1 up run which makes 265 km. However, before taking part one has to have trained well and built up sufficient mileage as part of training, the minimum recommended being 1500km - which I always make sure I have covered. It is difficult to say, really. All I know is that it’s a lot. I run through 2 pairs of running shoes each year, and that’s the bare minimum. 

**What inspired you to take part in this marathon?**

The first year I participated out of curiosity to see if I could complete it. I had grown up watching Comrades Marathon every year with my sister on SABC 2, and never thought I would ever be a part of it one day. Then I met a group of guys who had done it before and one of them ended up convincing me that I too can do it. I did, and it was a huge confidence booster, though I truly wanted to cry when I reached the 70th km. Comrades makes me realize that nothing is impossible. Where there is a will, one can accomplish anything. 

**What are some of the challenges you have come across in this adventure?**

One of my biggest challenges has been finances, getting to all my races, including comrades, requires a lot of money, and as a student it’s not always easy to put the money together. However, I found a job as a part-time student assistant and that helped a great deal. My team members have also helped me, especially sometimes offering free transport to my races in South Africa. Loss of motivation along the way is also sadly a huge challenge. As I run not to be number one, it is often easy to question why I am even bothering myself with it, especially when it starts getting cold, or my schedule as a student gets hectic.

**What does this Marathon mean to you?**

I consider the Comrades Marathon my annual pilgrimage, just as people travel to Moria, Israel, Jerusalem or Mecah. I plan to travel to Durban and run with God, allowing Him to guide my every step and give me strength to finish the Comrades Marathon year after year.
