Emotional stress and frustration can often cause you to express things you don’t mean to those you care about the most.  I have been somewhat feeling powerless and unable to motivate myself to do the necessary things in life. My mind poisoned by the bits and pieces of bad experiences that still linger and all of the scars I wear from years of terrible decisions; It is during these times that music becomes my best friend. They say music with a strong beat can stimulate brain waves which improve concentration, even after you’ve stopped listening.

Sorry fully accepted brings its own gifts, for there is alchemy in sorrow. It can be transmuted into wisdom, which if it does not bring joy, can yet bring happiness. Lately, I have been embracing all the challenges in my life as an opportunity for self-transformation. My courage has been tested and I won’t pretend as if nothing happened. It is during the times I am far outside my element that I experience myself the most. That I see and feel who I really am! That's why I enjoy taking myself out of my own comfort zone, and hurling myself out into the unknown. Because it's during  those unsure steps taken, that I am able to see who I really am and discover a smile I didn't know I had and I uncover  feelings that I didn't know existed in me.

I have challenged myself at initiating and maintaining wise friendships with those who will strengthen me in my faith, help me to grow in wisdom, and encourage me to live my life for the glory of God, because I know the rewards of such friendships will last throughout a lifetime! Friendships are some of the most powerful influencers in life, because friends greatly impact a person’s development and decisions. In my search for authentic friends, I have demonstrated sincerity and genuine love because I want an honest and transparent friendship. It is very important that we both honor our word. Promises made shall be fulfilled.

“I beg you, to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and to try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. Don’t search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live with them. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.” Through this quote I am also learning to be patient and show genuine love to negative reaction.

The people that I have been spending time with fulfil my needs. We discuss the power of influence and read motivational books. We share our hearts and lives which greatly impact us. The interests of great leaders, values, and priorities deeply influence us.

Most importantly I have forgiven those who wronged me, not because they deserve forgiveness, but because I deserve peace! “Confront the dark parts of yourself, and work to banish them with illumination and forgiveness. Your willingness to wrestle with your demons will cause your angels to sing.”
