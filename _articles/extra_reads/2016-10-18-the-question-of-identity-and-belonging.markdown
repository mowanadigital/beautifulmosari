_I emptied my backpack of all the costumes of the characters I sometimes play 

This is on days being myself proves a little too costly

I lost my make-up kit somewhere between really growing tired of pretense

and a craving for the feel of my own skin

I can’t say I loved it there

I just liked seeing how different people can treat the same person posing a thousand others

Someone should have told me, you cannot be you and a thousand others

You’re going to lose your voice to a thousand others

We’re going to get tired of your thousand others

And eventually you’re gonna be a ghost among your thousand others who drew strength and life from you

Be you because everyone else is taken

And your thousand others, really don’t exist_

We have names and cultures we belong to that speak of who we are and where we are from. But the passing of years sometimes sees us gravitating towards certain norms and cultures different from our own and may even possibly change our names. We do this and say we are adapting to the diversity and dynamic nature of culture. Truth is most times we are consumed by a desire to belong in places we find ourselves and with the people among whom we find ourselves.

In all this we lose ourselves, our identity. We adapt to be adopted by insatiable desires to belong, to fit in, to be part, to blend in. We file the edges of ourselves that prove too rough for the pack, the click in our tongue that turns heads and minds away from us. We bind our bleeding wounds and trust our scars to the work of a skilled make-up artist just to make the cut, to belong. We have become super heroes in the movies in which we are staring. Saving the world and displaying an array of ability.

We have adapted so as to be adopted but when we get home and unwrap our wounds, strip naked of perfection and our mascara runs down with the tears of reality, why is it that it hurts? How come we now can feel and this time pain? How come we can hear the sound of loneliness, the screeching sound of pain and abandonment? Could it be because we have sought home in all these different inventions around us and forget to keep even just a little bit of ourselves? Think about it. The subject of adoption promises escape but no one should ever have to escape from themselves. Perhaps we all need a reminder that we are enough. 

With your college degree and a tongue that refuses to roll without pronouncing all syllables in words, you are enough, with your hair all kinky and skin sun kissed, you are enough. You can be all you want, make it in your grind and still be you for us to trace back to your roots. It will speak of your people and their children, of the way they dance away the dark of stereotypes and uninformed misconceptions. After all is said and done, the world might not demand of you your name but your heart will want to settle with one who denied it not. Be a woman, own your crown and slay!
