Each year, young people graduate from different institutions of higher learning in their thousands to the escalating unemployment crises. We all know that a university degree today is no longer an assurance to a decent job let alone a means to earn a decent living. If not dealt with, this sad reality can be discouraging. So while you endeavour to figure things out, also look for opportunities to grow and develop yourself in various areas that could imbue you with skills because you cannot afford to stay idle.  Start now with these **TOP FIVE TIPS**:

**1. Don’t stay out of work**

The cheapest way to decrease in value is to stay idle. Try not to be too choosy with work, even the most successful people used to work as petrol attendants and waitresses! Never allow your lack of gainful employment authenticate your idleness. Try by all means to turn your inoperative time into effective moments. 

**2. Promote products or services for a company of interest**

Be open-minded! Companies are looking for clients they can sell their products to on a daily basis. Tap into this opportunity, avail yourself to provide this service. In the process you gain experience and you never know, this might turn out into a permanent paying job. 

**3. Provide consulting services **

You can train or consult people in your area of specialization and experience at a small fee. You can start off by test running your ideas with a few people that are in need of that particular field then with time you can turn this into a fully operational business. 

**4. Learn a new skill**

Beef up your formal education with some informal training. Learn upholstery, music, tailoring, there is just a lot you can do. Read up material to gain the essential blue collar skills and now with technology at our disposal, this can be done at the comfort of your own space and pace. Don’t limit yourself.

**5. Buy and Sell (Trade)**

Everyday people consume a lot of products, take advantage of this opportunity. Become a liaison between manufacturers and consumers. Procure goods at discounts and sell them. However make sure that whatever you will be procuring is legit and legal. You don’t want to get into trouble with the law. Remember……success is not for loungers.
